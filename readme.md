# Adaptive Shiver Sorting Algorithms
This Algorithm is written in C++ and is based on a paper written by [Vincent Jug√©](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SQr2ViRVeQhXDKDRt7_pcmKYn1ZOzucJ/view). We were assigned this algorithm as a Project for Design and Analysis of Algorithms course. This project was done by a group of four students. Writing a working algorithm in any language of our choice was a part 2 of this project.
