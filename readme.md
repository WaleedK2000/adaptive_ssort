# Adaptive Shiver Sorting Algorithm
This Algorithm is written in C++ and is based on a paper written by [Vincent Jug√©](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SQr2ViRVeQhXDKDRt7_pcmKYn1ZOzucJ/view). We were assigned this algorithm as a Project for Design and Analysis of Algorithms course. This project was done by a group of four students. Writing a working algorithm in any language of our choice was a part 2 of this project.

## Phase 1
We were supposed to study the research paper and then give a presentation on the following points.

	1. Description of the introduction of the domain necessary to understand the basic concept of the paper.

	2. Brief Discussion of the related work discussed by the authors.

	3. What is the aim of the paper? 
	
	4. What is the problem addressed in the paper?
	
	5.How the paper is different from the previous work as claimed by the authors.

	6. Details of the methodology adopted to solve the identified problem.

	7. How the authors have provided the evidence to justify their claims.
	
	8. Challenges that can be foreseen during the implementation of the paper.
	
Lastly, we also showed a simple dry run of the algorithm.

## Phase 2
In Phase 2 we had to code the algorithm in any language of our choice and give a live demo to our course instructor. We also had to show the results of the algorithm for a large set of data which we ran before the live demo and stored the result.
